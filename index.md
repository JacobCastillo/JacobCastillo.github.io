Lab 6
This was a fun lab for me because we used vectors and strings to be able to provide exactly three arguments. When you provided more than three arguments you were shown an error message. When the inputs are valid the program then constructs a sentence returning your sandwich order based on the arguments you provided. In part 2, we are creating a blackjack card game using code like command line arguments where it takes two cards adding them to give an output, 21, or bust. This is very close to game development or game programming. Which is something I always wanted to learn or take part in to discover how games are programmed. This lab provided a step to allow me to create a small blackjack game. 

Lab 8, part 2
This lab was one of my favorites because we use nested loops that created a pattern each time it ran through the iteration. This was a good lab to learn because it was a beneficial way to get more familiar with loops, especially nested loops which are used to solve complex problems. This also helped with knowing how to program the output in a better format while being able to control the flow of your program. 

Lab 9, part 2
This lab was fun because we used command line arguments and interacted with the user. Creating a program that is a bit like a game where the user needs to guess the secret number. This was good to learn because it does use the basics of file I/O which is used in real world software situations which is a key programming skill to learn.
